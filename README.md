# RaceGame\_Fisica2

## Description

A top-down racing game developed in C++ using the Box2D physics engine. Created as part of the Physics II course at CITM (UPC), this project emulates classic arcade racing mechanics. The game features realistic vehicle physics, AI-controlled opponents, and a complete lap timing system, demonstrating the implementation of rigid body dynamics, collisions, and sensors in a real-time environment.

## Key Features

* Realistic 2D Physics: Utilization of the Box2D library to simulate vehicle handling, friction, collisions, and track interaction in real-time without uncontrolled bullet-time effects.
* Competitive AI: Includes CPU-controlled opponents that navigate the track, providing a challenging racing experience.
* Game Loop \& UI: Complete gameplay flow with a start/end, individual lap timers, and a "Best Time" tracker for the current session.
* Debug Mode: Integrated development tools activated by key F1, allowing visualization of physics colliders/shapes and interaction via Mouse Joint.

## Controls

* A / D or Left / Right Arrows: Steer the vehicle (Turn Left / Turn Right).
* Spacebar: Activate special ability.
* F1: Toggle Debug Mode (View colliders and enable Mouse Joint).
